# Alcohol Consumption

This project analyzes alcohol consumption data to explore relationships between various types of alcohol servings (beer, spirits, and wine) and total alcohol consumption across different countries. The dataset used in this analysis includes the number of servings of beer, wine, and spirits, as well as the total liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita in each country.

The analysis includes:
* Data exploration and visualization
* Linear and machine learning models to predict total alcohol consumption
* Evaluation of model performance using different techniques

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of alcohol consumption patterns across countries, using both visualizations and predictive modeling. The machine learning models (linear regression, decision tree, and random forest) help predict total alcohol consumption based on different types of alcohol servings. The performance of each model is evaluated using MSE and RMSE, helping to identify the most accurate predictive model.
